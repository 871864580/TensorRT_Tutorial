TensorRT Release Notes

TensorRT 2.0 EA

Please note that we've changed the name of the product in version 2 from GIE to TensorRT. 

This release is an early access release for testing INT8 functionality. Please see the User Guide for detailed information on
how to use this feature. The following are known issues with the current build:

* some layers may not function correctly if channel counts or convolution group sizes are not multiples of 4
* for INT8 and FP16 networks, deconvolution stride and kernel size must be equal

If you are working with FP32 or FP16 we recommend that you continue using GIE 1.0.

* spelling error corrected in IBuilder::platformHasFastFp16()
* Methods where null is not a legal value now take ITensor& arguments rather than ITensor*
* The CaffeParser class is now exposed via the ICaffeParser interface, and the shutdownProtobufLibrary is a standalone function.
